# Flight Weather Delay Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between wind speed and flight departure delays for flights in 2022. The analysis groups flights based on wind speed and examines its impact on the average departure delay at different airports.

## Features
- Analyze flight delays based on wind speed categories (e.g., `< 10 mph` and `>= 10 mph`).
- Compare average departure delays at different airports (e.g., PDX, SEA).
- Group flights by wind speed and origin to calculate the mean departure delay.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.5
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains flight and weather data from 2022. 

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kapilan747/flight-weather-analysis.git
```
   
2.Install the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy seaborn
  ```

3.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
  ```

Results
  The analysis provides insights into how wind speeds affect flight delays and highlights key differences between airports.
